%Formatting%
Formatting has three main attributes, ~BOLD~, ^Reverse^ and @underline@

and they look like this;

{{{~BOLD~
^Reverse^
@underline@}}}

You can turn all elements off (for say, showing code) with triple braces.

The above piece of code looks like this;

{{{{{{
~BOLD~
^Reverse^
@underline@
}}}}}}

Please note, you cant mix your formatting, and when one ends
it goes back to normal, so a bold inside of a reverse wont
have the effect you think it will.

example; ~BOLD with ^Reverse^ inside~ now out of bold tag.

{{{example; ~BOLD with ^Reverse^ inside~ now out of bold tag.}}}

it can be done like this;

{{{example; ~BOLD with ~^Reverse^~ inside~ now out of bold tag.}}}

example; ~BOLD with ~^Reverse^~ inside~ now out of bold tag.

You can create a link to a subtopic (page title) like this

%%LINK%SubTopic%%

That code looks like this {{{%%LINK%SubTopic%%}}}

The other feature is having the guide build a list of topics automatically
for you.

%%LIST%%

which looks like this {{{%%LIST%%}}}.

The ^LIST^ and ^LINK^ items both take up to 32 separators.

You can think of separators as subtitles. For example you can have text like;


{{{
%Chapter 1%
text here...
%Chapter 1%Paragraph 1%
para 1 here
%Chapter 1%Paragraph 2%
para 2 here
%Chapter 1%Paragraph 3%
para 3 here
}}}

and using a list as {{{%%LIST%Chapter 1%}}} will show you a list like this

{{{Paragraph 1
Paragraph 2
Paragraph 3
}}}

And having a link jump directly to paragraph 3 you can use {{{%%LINK%Chapter 1%Paragraph 3%%}}}


%SubTopic%
This is a sub-topic.
