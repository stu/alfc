Another Linux File Commander
by Stu George

What is it?
ALFC is a clone of a famous old DOS program called Norton Commander.

ALFC embeds the Lua scripting language to give you a lot of power
and flexability in your system management.

Portability
Notes on the MinGW port.
- MinGW seems to only have a 32bit st_size in the stat buffer for filesizes...
- MinGW requires the 'regex' package (both bin + dev) to be installed for building.
for distribution you need the regex dll from the bin package
(Put the DLL in your windows/system32 directory or somewhere like that)
- You also need a copy of the fnmatch.h header filer
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob;f=lib/fnmatch.in.h;hb=HEAD
just save that as /mingw/include/fnmatch.h
